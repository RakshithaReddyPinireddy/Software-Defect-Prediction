# Software Defect Prediction Using an Intelligent Ensemble-Based Model

## 📌 Project Overview
Software Defect Prediction aims to identify defective modules in software systems at an early stage of development. Early detection helps reduce cost, improve software quality, and support better decision-making during testing and maintenance.

This project uses **machine learning ensemble techniques** to predict software defects using historical project data.
